        <h2>Keeping Research Alive</h2>
        <h3>When the System Fails, Keep Moving</h3>
        <p>
            Scientific discovery shouldnâ€™t stop because funding disappears. Science Sustained provides affordable, high-impact computing solutions for researchers facing grant cuts, funding loss, or institutional roadblocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Research doesnâ€™t just happen in universities. Citizen scientists, independent researchers, and DIY biologists are pushing the boundaries of knowledge tooâ€”often without access to the tools they need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether youâ€™re an academic researcher, a garage biologist, or an independent scientist running experiments in your basement, weâ€™re here to help. If youâ€™re doing real science, you deserve real support.
        </p>
        <h3>This Isnâ€™t A Company. Itâ€™s A Support Group.</h3>
        <p>What We Offer:<br />
        âœ… High-Performance & Cloud Computing â€“ Get the compute power you need without breaking the bank.<br />
        âœ… Bioinformatics & Scientific Software Optimization â€“ Faster, better, and more efficient research workflows.<br />
        âœ… Citizen Scientist Support â€“ You donâ€™t need a university affiliation to do real science. We help independent researchers access computing resources, open-source tools, and expert guidance.<br />
        âœ… Custom Solutions for Your Research â€“ Need something specific? Weâ€™ll figure it out.<br /><br />

        ðŸ’¡ If the institutions wonâ€™t support us, weâ€™ll support each other.

        <h2>Open-Source. Ethical. DIY.</h2>
<p>We run on open-source activism, ethical computing, and radical collaboration.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t about maximizing profitsâ€”itâ€™s about making research computing as affordable as humanly possible. We believe in grassroots solutions to academic problems. Weâ€™re DIY, pirate radio, punk rockâ€”because scientific research doesnâ€™t belong to corporations, it belongs to everyone pushing the boundaries of knowledge.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve dedicated your life to science but lost the funding to continue, this is your community.</p>

        <h2>The Long-Term Vision</h2>
<p>Science Sustained isnâ€™t just a serviceâ€”itâ€™s a movement. Weâ€™re building a community-driven, decentralized network where researchers share resources, support each other, and keep their work aliveâ€”no matter what.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t wait for permission. We make our own solutions.</p>

        <h2>Join the Science Sustained Community</h2>
ðŸš€ At the very least, weâ€™d love for you to join our Discord of fellow researchers.

Whether you need computing support, advice, or just a place to connect with others who refuse to let science grind to a halt, this is where we collaborate, share resources, and help each other out.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
<h3>Keeping Research Alive Through Computing & Community</h3>
<p>I'm Brian, and I helped start Science Sustained because I believe scientific discovery shouldnâ€™t stop due to funding cuts. After 20 years in the computing industry, I set out to transition into academia to pursue research myself. But just as I was a few semesters away from completing my biology degree, NIH and NSF funding were slashed. Suddenly, I saw a bigger problemâ€”researchers who had dedicated their lives to science were losing the support they needed to keep their work going.</p>

<p>I realized I could make a bigger impact not by becoming a researcher myself, but by supporting those who already were. With my experience in cloud computing, high-performance computing (HPC), bioinformatics, and infrastructure building, I knew I could help scientists keep moving forwardâ€”even when funding agencies and institutions wouldnâ€™t.</p>

<h3>What We Stand For</h3>
<p>Science Sustained is built on open-source activism, ethical computing, and radical collaboration. Weâ€™re DIY, pirate radio, punk rockâ€”because if the powers that be wonâ€™t support us, weâ€™ll support each other.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t about maximizing profit. Itâ€™s about making research as affordable as humanly possible so that the people pushing the boundaries of human knowledge can keep going.</p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>We provide whatever computing support researchers need to keep their work alive, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>HPC, cloud, and infrastructure setup</li>
<li>Research software optimization</li>
<li>Help with grant budgeting for computing resources</li>
<li>Bioinformatics & scientific computing support</li>
<li>Custom solutions for any computing challenges youâ€™re facing</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need something that isnâ€™t on this list, weâ€™ll figure it out together.</p>

<h3>The Bigger Vision</h3>
<p>Science Sustained is more than a serviceâ€”it's a movement. In the long run, we want to build a community-driven, open-source, decentralized network of researchers supporting each other. A place where scientists whoâ€™ve lost funding donâ€™t have to stop workingâ€”where the tools and resources they need are shared, sustained, and always accessible.</p>

<p>If that sounds like the kind of world you want to be part of, letâ€™s make it happen.</p>
